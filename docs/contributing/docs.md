## How to help

You will be of invaluable help if you contribute to the documentation.

Such a contribution can be:

- Indications of inaccuracies, errors, typos
- Suggestions for editing specific sections
- Making additions

You can report all this in [discussions](https://github.com/waku-py/waku/discussions) on GitHub or by opening
an [issue](https://github.com/waku-py/waku/issues).

## How to get started

1. Follow the steps for development setup in the [contributing guide](index.md#development-setup)
2. Start the local documentation server for live preview of changes

    ```shell
    mkdocs serve
    ```

3. Go to the `docs/` directory and make your changes

After making all the changes, you can issue a `PR` with them - and we will gladly accept it!
